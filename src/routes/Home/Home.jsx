        cText="I never expected the impact Rho Delta Chi would have on me. Coming straight 
        into college after 2 years of COVID through high school, I was hesitant to find my 
        place at A&M. I ultimately made the decision to try rushing a sorority and was 
        immediately drawn to Rho due to the kind & open arms these wonderful ladies 
        surrounded me with. I have met such amazing individuals that I can relate to 
        ranging from my personality to my culture; My forever best friends who by my side, 
        are consistently uplifting my confidence, energy, and supporting my life goals & 
        dreams.  My growth from being a timid sophomore rushee to becoming President of 
        this beautiful sorority could not have been accomplished without them who bring so 
        much insight, blessings, and opportunities. As President, I hope to contribute in 
        allowing our sorority to continue to grow and strive in the ways our founders and 
        past leaders have set up for us. I am so excited for our Fall â€˜24 Rush semester!"
