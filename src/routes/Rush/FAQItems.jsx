    message : "Rho Delta Chi was established on January 17, 1991 as the first Asian American sorority at the University of California, Riverside. In 1995, Rho Delta Chi was established as the first Asian interest sorority on A&M's campus. We were formed to increase Asian awareness, provide services in the best interest of the community, and unite women of different backgrounds through sisterhood. We have 6 chapters and 1 colony throughout California and Texas. Our 4 Pillars, Service, Scholastics, Sisterhood, and Social, have provided us a great foundation where a loving and strong sisterhood grew into the amazing organization that it is today!",
